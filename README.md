# retail-demo
 Demo web app for a retailer
 
# Description
This application was created over the course of 3 weeks to display an understanding of fullstack development
The front end was created using the javascript with the react framework and the backend was made in java
using the spring boot framework
This is a demo for an e-commerce site that allows users to search from a database of items to add to a shopping cart
and then "purchase" their chosen items although that simply stores the items in the cart as an order in the database
If you are an admin you may also choose to add edit or delete any items from the database

# Installation
This demo is a locally hosted fullstack application runnig on port 9080
You will need both sql and node installed on your machine to be able to run it
To run the demo you will first need to open the properties file in BackEnd/retail-demo/src/main/java/recources/
and change the username and password to fit your local sql database

#Usage
To run the program simply start the backend in any IDE and then run the front end by typing the npm start command in the console
at the front end folders terminal
If you would like to use admin functionality you must first create an account named "admin". This will allow you to create items for
the database to work with as it comes empty

#Compatability
This application is completly mobile friendly and is able to run on any and all operating systems other than apple products
